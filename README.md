# Algorithms-and-data-structures
This repo contains the implementation for various known data structures and algortihms and solutions to problems on various online cp platforms.

# Deltamodulation
the files contain thec implementation of delta modulation. The graph is plotted using matplotlib library of python which in turn is invoked using a system call.
Three output files are generated.

1.Redblacktrees'
2.Ford Fulkerson algortihm for finding max-flow in a graph.
